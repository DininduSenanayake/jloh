 -- Extraction
    g2g                 Align two genomes to find regions that should carry SNPs
    extract             Extract LOH blocks from VCF, BAM and FASTA files
    filter              Filter extracted LOH blocks
    intersect           Perform intersection/removal operations with output files
    chimeric            Extract genes featuring LOH blocks from different haplotypes

 -- Calculations
    stats               Estimate heterozygous and homozygous SNP statistics
    junctions           Calculate number of block-to-block junctions over the genome

 -- Simulation
    sim                 Simulate a divergent copy of a genome

 -- Visualization
    plot                Make an LOH propensity plot from "extract" output file(s)
