Run JLOH with a test dataset
============================

If you wish to perform a test run to see the output files and their structure, we have prepared a test dataset starting from the NCBI genomic read accession SRR12033503 and the sequence of the chromosome XII of *S. paradoxus*. This dataset can be found in the ``test_data`` folder, within the installation directory.

+------------------+--------+---------------------------+
| File             | Format | Description               |
+==================+========+===========================+
| S_para.chrXII.fa | FASTA  | Reference sequence        |
+------------------+--------+---------------------------+
| out.fs.bam       | BAM    | File with mapping results |
+------------------+--------+---------------------------+
| out.ff.vcf       | VCF    |File with called SNPs      |
+------------------+--------+---------------------------+

.. note::

    A key feature of the VCF file used here is that it contains allele frequency (AF) annotation in the FORMAT (8th) field. This is crucial for :ref:`jloh-extract` to work.


Get LOH blocks
--------------

To infer LOH blocks from the test dataset, you first should model the distribution of SNP densities across the genome with :ref:`jloh-stats`. 

To do so, use the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash 

    jloh stats --vcf out.ff.vcf 


This command produces the quantiles of heterozygous and homozygous SNP densities. Their need is described in :ref:`jloh-stats` and :ref:`quickstart`.

Then, we proceed inferring LOH blocks from the dataset. This is done with the :ref:`jloh-extract` module. We used this command: 

.. code-block:: bash 

    jloh extract \
    --vcf out.ff.vcf --bam out.fs.bam --ref S_para.chrXII.fa \
    --min-snps-kbp 2,5 --output-dir jloh_out 


The output will be placed in the ``jloh_out`` directory. The most important file produced by this command is the ``jloh.LOH_blocks.tsv`` file. This file contains the detected LOH blocks based on the distribution of heterozygous and homozygous SNPs. It is accompanied by a BED file representing the same intervals in a 0-based half-open fashion. 

The ``jloh.LOH_blocks.tsv`` file can be passed to the :ref:`jloh-plot` module to represent LOH graphically with this command:

.. code-block:: bash 

    jloh plot \
    --one-ref \
    --loh jloh_out/jloh.LOH_blocks.tsv \
    --het jloh_out/jloh.exp.het_blocks.bed \
    --contrast max 


Due to the low variation in the test dataset, we have increased the ``--contrast`` to the maximum value to highlight potential LOH regions. The ``--one-ref`` option indicates that the :ref:`jloh-extract` was run in default mode with only one reference FASTA file. 

Here's how the plot should look like.
